/**
The state handler is a FSM-ish handler for the various points in a single task's
lifetime. The hooks provided by this module are used to extend the basic
behaviour of task handling (and hand in hand with feature flags allow granular
selection of actions which have various performance impacts on the task being
run).

Each "state" in the lifetime is a well defined function:

  - link    : prior to creating the task container returning containers to be
              linked in.

  - created : After the container has been created but prior to running the
              container. Useful for loggers, etc... No value is returned.

  - stopped : After the container has completely run (not run in cases where the
              container has not run).

  - killed:   After the task container has been entirely removed. The intention
              is for this to be used to cleanup any remaining linked containers.
